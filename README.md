## Features

Multipass comes packed with a variety of features:

- **API Auto-Discovery**: Automatically discover and expose methods from any Python library.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle errors gracefully.
- **Health Check**: Monitor the health of your API endpoints.
- **Data Processing**: Seamlessly integrate with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation.
- **Machine Vision Support**: Use libraries like YOLO for image processing tasks.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Integrate with NLP libraries like Transformers.
- **Monitoring**: Keep track of API performance and usage.

## Installation

To install Multipass, you can use pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install multipass
```

You can also download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/robson240/multipass/releases). After downloading, execute the setup file to install Multipass.

## Usage

Using Multipass is straightforward. Here‚Äôs a simple example:

```python
from multipass import Multipass

# Initialize the API wrapper
api = Multipass()

# Register a Python library
api.register_library('example_library')

# Call a method from the library
result = api.call('example_library.method_name', args)
print(result)
```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Key Concepts

### API Auto-Discovery

Multipass uses reflection to automatically discover methods from the registered libraries. This feature eliminates the need for manual configuration, allowing you to focus on your application logic.

### Error Handling

Multipass includes robust error handling. If a method call fails, the API returns meaningful error messages. This helps you diagnose issues quickly.

### Health Check

You can perform health checks on your API endpoints. This feature ensures that your API is responsive and functioning as expected.

### Data Processing

Multipass integrates with Pandas, making it easy to handle data frames and perform complex data manipulations. 

### Machine Vision

With support for libraries like YOLO, you can easily incorporate machine vision capabilities into your applications. 

### Natural Language Processing

Integrate NLP features using popular libraries like Transformers. Multipass simplifies the process of making complex NLP models accessible via an API.
